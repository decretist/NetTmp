## Network

Temporary (?) repository to share stylo bootstrap consensus network
html files on GitHub. Stylo bootstrap consensus network html files
can be displayed on GitHub, but only via GitHub Pages.

See [Stylometry with
stylo](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/stylo_nutshell/)
for basic instructions.

+ `stylo.network()` for interactive D3 visualization
+ `stylo(network = TRUE)` for static Gephi visualization

Current visualization reflects a top-down division of the *Decretum*
along lines suggested by Franz Gillmann and Alfred Beyer.

The alternative would be a bottom-up division of the *dicta* into
2500- to 3500- word samples using
[segment.py](https://github.com/decretist/Gratian/blob/master/samples/hand/segment/segment.py).
